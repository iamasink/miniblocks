# miniblocks

silly minecraft datapack using the new interaction and block display entities :3  

requires 1.19.4+

it probably only works on singleplayer right now sorry ;-;  

run `/function miniblocks:grid` to spawn a plane of miniblocks where you're standing, with the block you're holding.  
also you can do `/execute align xyz run function miniblocks:summon` to spawn a single mini block aligned to the corner  

you can only place other mini blocks by clicking on another  
everything else should be self explanatory
